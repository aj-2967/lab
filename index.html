                On a technical level, the Vision AVTR is fitted with a 100% electric engine developing
                475 hp and powered by innovative organic batteries with an autonomy of 700 km. Using
                graphene-based organic cell chemistry batteries containing no rare earths and metals,
                the battery materials would therefore be compostable and completely recyclable.
                This is an interesting response to the environmental, economic and political problems
                and challenges facing conventional batteries.
